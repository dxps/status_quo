# Status Quo

## The Vision

This solution has the business awareness to collect data related to process and flows, process it, present and react through publishing aggregated facts, whereas the affected parties - both UI and APIs - could adapt to the changes.

All the capabilities are being done based on:
- knowing the business flows
- observing (listening and collecting) what's happening

Thus, it can:
- render outcomes on one or multiple events, based on dependencies
- inform relevant parties (systems and humans) to adapt accordingly,
  and properly manage their service degradation capability
